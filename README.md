# Alenka üëß

Alenka is a free library for predicting Russian names (and genders) from transliterated and short forms with statistical learning and Levenshtein distance.

Alenka now is not a tool for inflection (see [Lvovich](inflect)) or parsing first/middle/last Russian names from strings. But it will somewhen be.

## Advantages

Useful for social data and media analysis.

üåÄ Natively in TypeScript

üî¢ Statistically trained

‚ù§ Simple and friendly API

‚öô Configurable

## Usage

Install Alenka with `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
npm i alenka
yarn add alenka
```

Using with default configuration

```typescript
import { NamePredictor } from "alenka";

const np = new NamePredictor();

np.predictName('–°–∞–Ω—è', 'male') // '–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä'
np.predictName('–°–∞–Ω—è', 'female') // '–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∞'
np.predictName('–°–∞–Ω—è') // '–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä' as more frequent
np.predictName('–°–∏—Ä–æ–∂–∞') // '–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π'
np.predictName('$one4ka') // '–°–æ—Ñ–∏—è'
np.predictGender('$one4ka') // female
np.predictName('asdasda') // undefined
```

Using with custom configuration

```typescript
import { NamePredictor } from "alenka";

const options = {
    useLevenshtein: false,
    // minAcceptibleDistance: 1,
    // frequenciesSource: 'vk',
    // handlingCase: 'ignore',
    // handlingYo: 'ignore',
} as const;

const np = new NamePredictor(options);

np.predictName('–°–∏—Ä–æ–∂–∞') // 'unedfined'
```

## Terminology

![Terminology diagram](./docs/diagram.svg)

1. Names are full forms of Russian Names (e.g. `–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä` or `–°–æ—Ñ–∏—è`);
2. Shorts are shotened forms of names (e.g. `–°–∞—à–∞` or `–°–æ–Ω–µ—á–∫–∞`);
3. Transliterations are latin versions of names or shorts (e.g. `Alex` or `Sofia`);
4. Variants are names, shorts and transliterations together;
5. Tokens are any strings including variatns (e.g. `$0nechk@`, `abcdefg`).

prediction is mapping a token to a name. It happens via mathcing token agains a dataset of shorts and transliterations with Levenshtein distance to find the closest one and return the relevant name. If nothing matched, undefined will be returned.

## Contribution

Feel free to fork and leave pull requests.

To start development just run following familiar commands. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solovevserg/alenka.git
cd alenka
yarn install
yarn test:watch
```

### Roadmap

Here a list of actual tasks to participate at. Thanks in advance for any help.

* Fix problems with handling '—ë'
* Split in the dataset variants for shorts and tranliterations
* Finish README
* Add issues board (bug tracker)
* Add ESLint
* Add missing short forms to the data source
* Write transliteration logic (instead of cyrillic-to-translit-js)
* Optimize performance
